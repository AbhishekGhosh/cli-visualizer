- improve reading from alsa
    -probably involves using the alsa api directly

- find default sink some how for pulseaudio
    - probably involves using pulse audio api directly instead of pulseaudio simple
        then reading the source list

- add direct mac os x support
    -involves hooking into CoreAudio probably with AVAudioSession  https://github.com/syedhali/EZAudio/blob/master/EZAudio/EZAudioDevice.m

- use configure or something similar to check for libraries and which compiler to use and flags

- improve readme
    - add more examples for
        falloff
        smoothing options
        spectrum bar width and spacing
        margins
        reverse

    - add better explanation of color scheme options
        add examples of different colors schemes

    - add examples of visualizers with different characters

- add windows support
    - probably just ncurses through cygwin
    - audio source would be some windows api
    - use define guards everywhere there are *nix dependent includes
